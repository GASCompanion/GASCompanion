# Introduction

Leveraging the power of the Gameplay Ability System, this plugin provides a starting point and a robust foundation to speed up the creation of a new project based on GAS.

It includes the necessary C++ code and Blueprints to get started on a new project that aims to use Epic's GAS plugin (used namely in Fortnite and Paragon, and showcased in Action RPG project)
 
## Features

- **Provided as a Plugin** to easily share code between projects
- **Blueprint Friendly**, no need to dive into the cpp side, you can implement Abilities right away
- **C++ Friendly too!** You can easily extend from the provided C++ class or modify the plugin source.
    - GAS Companion aims to be a general base for GAS powered projects without making any game design choices. The system is intended to be subclassed and customized per project needs.
- **Not Game specific** The plugin doesn't make assumptions about your game design and decisions, and was built to be generic enough to be used in any kind of game.
- **Ability Queueing System** (with a Debug Widget)
- **Ignore Ability Cost** feature (Possibility to "loosely" check cost for Abilities (to allow activation of abilities when resources are > 0))
- AttributeSet setup with most commonly used Attributes (Health, Stamina, Mana)
- ASC on PlayerState (for Player characters) or on Pawns (for AI / NPC Characters)
