Note that from the 6.0.0 release of this changelog, you can now click on Pull Request links (identified by a number prefixed by a `#`) to get further information about the related changes (new features / bugfix, etc.).

With each PR, I tend to put a little bit of documentation and some screenshots about the added features, what it does etc.

They can often serve as the basics of documentation before the website is updated to reflect the changes.

## [6.0.0](https://github.com/GASCompanion/GASCompanion-Plugin/releases/tag/6.0.0) - Jun 29, 2023

<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at ue5-main -->

##### Breaking Changes ðŸ› 

*   Adding IGameplayTagAssetInterface to modular gameplay actors in [#65](./pull/65)
*   Remove deprecated GSCTemplate definitions and get rid of class viewer warning in output log in [#68](./pull/68)

These two could be considered breaking changes. Check [#65](./pull/65) for potential required changes with IGameplayTagAssetInterface addition, if your custom C++ classes inheriting from one of the Actors provided by GSC was implementing the interface.

Deprecated GSCTemplate assets were obsolete for a very long time, it would only impact you if you were still using them directly as Parent class of your Gameplay Effects.

##### Bug Fixes

*   Fix few includes for 5.2 rocket build in [#74](./pull/74)
*   Fix implementation of AGSCModularPlayerState::CopyProperties() that was causing issues during travels between maps in [#75](./pull/75)

##### Other Changes

*   refactor: Convert all UPROPERTY native pointers to TObjectPtr in [#69](./pull/69)
*   Refactored Project Settings to have GAS Companion exposed settings appear within their own category, and not below the "Game" category anymore. in [#70](./pull/70)
*   Fixes for non unity build in [#80](./pull/80)

## [3.2.0](https://github.com/GASCompanion/GASCompanion-Plugin/releases/tag/3.2.0) - Dec 30, 2021

##### New Features

*   **AbilityInputBinding:**
    *   UMGCAbilityInputBindingComponent now provides a way to get back the InputAction that is bound to a given Gameplay Ability ([91f26fc8](https://github.com/mklabs/GASCompanion-Plugin/commit/91f26fc8345d692597c50924ce569b9fb96365c1))
        *   Added `UMGCAbilityInputBindingComponent::GetBoundInputActionForAbility()` Blueprint exposed method
        *   Designed to be called from within a Gameplay Ability event graph, passing self reference for the Gameplay Ability parameter.
    *   Add `GetAbilityInputBindingComponent` helper in Blueprint Function Library ([6ca63b6e](https://github.com/mklabs/GASCompanion-Plugin/commit/6ca63b6e562df5804e6f66e917c303ff9a07c479))
    *   Expose property to specify the input trigger event for ability activation ([b3fed7d6](https://github.com/mklabs/GASCompanion-Plugin/commit/b3fed7d640d6d55f6864387c41e459ae12e32184))
        *   Added TriggerEvent property on Granted Abilities structure for MGCAbilitySystemComponent and Game Feature Action (AddAbilities). TriggerEvent property only appear when InputAction is defined
        *   Added TriggerEvent param to Blueprint exposed `UMGCAbilityInputBindingComponent::SetInputBinding`

> The most common trigger types are likely to be Started for actions that happen once, immediately upon pressing a button, and Triggered for continuous actions that happen every frame while holding an input.

> ***Warning**: The Triggered value should only be used for Input Actions that you know only trigger once. If your action triggered event happens on every tick, this might lead to issues with ability activation (since you'll be trying to activate abilities every frame). When in doubt, use the default Started value.*

*   Add `UGSCAssetManager` to handle InitGlobalData and expose a setting to prevent GlobalData initialization from GAS Companion StartupModule ([b09208de](https://github.com/mklabs/GASCompanion-Plugin/commit/b09208de02be0454c0d369d916766ed5896d3caa))
    *   New Plugin Setting: `Project Settings > Game > GAS Companion > Prevent Ability System Global Data Initialization in Startup Module`
    *   Turning on this option will disable the initialisation from happening in companion runtime module to let you handle it in either your AssetManager class or GameInstance. Also adding in UGSCAssetManager to handle that (the editor should prompt you if you'd like to use it when you turn on bPreventGlobalDataInitialization, notif should only appear if the Asset Manager Class Name is set to engine's default)

##### Bug Fixes

*   **GSCTargetTypeUseEventData:**  Extract hit results from EventData's target data ([ad9345db](https://github.com/mklabs/GASCompanion-Plugin/commit/ad9345db96ad13578282945108c734c8a34faabd))
