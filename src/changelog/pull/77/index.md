*[on June 25th, 2023](https://github.com/GASCompanion/GASCompanion-Plugin/pull/77)*

## Add ThirdPerson project templates (BP/CPP)

GAS Companion template projects, with standard Third person pack features.

Includes standard movement from Third Person template, a Character Blueprint with GSCModularCharacter parent class, GSCAttributeSet as default attributes, an HUD added to player screen, a Jump Ability with GE cost and stamina regen effect and Anim Blueprints with Gameplay Tag property mapping.

The cpp template is pretty much the same as the BP template, but with a single minimal ACharacter class as a direct child class of `AGSCModularCharacter`.

Note: Created in engine 5.0.3, and should be forward compatible in 5.1 / 5.2.

## Plugins

			"MarketplaceURL": "com.epicgames.launcher://ue/marketplace/product/d83c6f34c3fb4b7092dde195c37c7413"
		}
  ]
```
