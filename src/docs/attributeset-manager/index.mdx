description: Learn how to react to Attributes changes from Blueprints
---

AttributeSetManagers are meant to be implemented in Blueprint and can assist in dealing with AttributeSet from Blueprints.

It exposes Blueprint Implementable Events for [`PreAttributeChange`](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation#concepts-as-preattributechange) and [`PostGamepayEffectExecute`](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation#concepts-as-postgameplayeffectexecute) that lets you handle attribute changes from Blueprints, like clamp or adjust the value of an attribute when it's associated max attribute changes.

If it is configured in [Project Settings](/configuration), your AttributeSetManager events will be fired off from native AttributeSets.

***Note:*** *The use of AttributeSet Managers is totally optional, you can use the generated c++ attribute set to handle attribute changes, like you would usually do in GAS.*

## AttributeSetManager Blueprint

To create an AttributeSetManager, right-click from the Content Browser, and select Blueprint Class.

![](create-bp-class-dropdown.png)

In the next window, choose `GSCAttributeSetManager` as a parent class.

![](create-bp-class-parent.png)

And name your Blueprint however you like, however in this tutorial we are going to name it `BP_AttributeSetManager`.

The next step is to tell the plugin which AttributeSetManager it should use to fire off events from native c++ AttributeSets (child of `GSCAttributeSetBase`)

![](atttributeset-manager-configuration.png)

You can now open your AttributeSetManager Blueprint.

### PostGameplayEffectExecute

Let's start with `PostGameplayEffectExecute` event. When you first open the Blueprint, its Blueprint Graph is empty.

To implement the event, you can right-click somewhere in the graph and search for `On Post Gameplay Effect Execute`

![](graph-post-ge-execute.png)

Alternately, you can use the `Override` dropdown from the "My Blueprint" panel on the left

![](override-event-ge-execute.png)

You'll be granted with the corresponding [`PostGameplayEffectExecute`](/api/gsc-attribute-set-manager/#onpostgameplayeffectexecute) event node.

![](execute-node.png)

This is the ideal place to perform action like `Clamp` on your attributes. For instance, if you want your attributes to always have values within a certain range.

This is already done for the "default" Attributes (Health, Stamina, Mana) but any new attributes you generated via the [class wizard](/gameplay-attributes/#add-attributeset-c-class-wizard) may need special care here.

Drag off the pin for `Attribute` and type [`Switch on Gameplay Attribute`](api/gsck-2-node-switch-gameplay-attribute/).

![](switch-on-attribute.png)

This is a custom GAS Companion node made to ease the process of branching conditions in Blueprints based off Gameplay Attributes. Select the switch node, and define new Cases in the details panel (on the right of the Blueprint Graph by default) by clicking the `+` icon next to "Pin Attributes".

![](switch-details.png)

And select the Gameplay Attribute you want to define as a test case.

![](switch-details-vitality.png)

In this instance, this is going to be `StatsAttributeSet.Vitality` we generated in the previous page.

Now, drag off the switch test case and type [`ClampAttributeValue`](/api/gsc-attribute-set-manager/#clampattributevalue).

![](clamp.png)

This helper function is made to do what you would usually do in the `PostGameplayEffectExecute` method of your AttributeSet in c++. Choose the Attribute you want to affect, and the minimum / maximum values.

If you have an associated MaxAttribute, you can use it for the higher bound of the clamp with the [`GetAttributeValue`](/api/gsc-attribute-set-manager/#getattributevalue) function.
 
![](clamp-with-max-attributes.png)

If you have an associated MinAttribute, you can use that as well using the same method (but make sure to plug the return value of the Attribute getter to the Min Value pin)

Similarly, if you have configured a Clamp Minimum Value in [Project's Settings](/configuration), you can access this value with the event Payload structure. Commonly used with [Ignore Ability Cost](/ignore-ability-cost) property of abilities.

![](clamp-minimum-value.png)

You can add as many Attribute switch case as you want, and clamp all the attributes you wish. To improve readability, it is then advised to collapse some of those nodes in their own Blueprint function.

![](collapse-nodes-to-function.png)

![](postge-execute-with-collapsed-function.png)

### PreAttributeChange

This event is commonly used to adjust the value of an Attribute when its Max associated Attribute change. For instance, you have the Vitality Attribute current value set to 20% of MaxVitality Attribute value (eg. Vitality: 50, MaxVitality: 200).

If the MaxVitality Attribute changes (with a level up or another Gameplay Effect), you might want to adjust the value of Vitality to reflect that. Let's demonstrate that use case.

***Note:*** *"Default" attributes PreAttribute change for Health, Stamina and Mana is already handled by the plugin.*

Like we did for the PostGameplayEffectExecute, override the [`PreAttributeChange`](/api/gsc-attribute-set-manager/#onpreattributechange) event node and create a [`Switch on Gameplay Attribute`](/api/gsck-2-node-switch-gameplay-attribute/) node, followed by an [`AdjustAttributeForMaxChange`](/api/gsc-attribute-set-manager/#adjustattributeformaxchange) function call.

![](on-pre-attribute-change.png)

Make sure to react to **Max Attributes** though, and affect the related attribute. It's easy to enter an infinite loop if you misuse attributes there, in which case the Engine will warn you.

In this case, we only react when MaxVitality changes, and we adjust the related Vitality attribute using MaxVitality as the Max Attribute parameter of [`AdjustAttributeForMaxChange`](/api/gsc-attribute-set-manager/#adjustattributeformaxchange). Lastly, we use the `NewValue` float from the event as the `NewMaxValue` of [`AdjustAttributeForMaxChange`](/api/gsc-attribute-set-manager/#adjustattributeformaxchange).

## Test in Game

### Test the Clamp (in PostGameplayEffectExecute)

Initialize the value of your attributes with a Gameplay Effect, and set this effect as the `Startup Attributes` of your character (if you haven't one already)

![](character-startup-attributes.png)

Here's the attribute modifiers from my `GE_Player_Attributes` effect.

![](ge-player-attributes.png)

First, we'll test the clamping we did in [`PostGameplayEffectExecute`](/api/gsc-attribute-set-manager/#onpostgameplayeffectexecute). To that end, we'll create a regen Gameplay Effect for this purpose. It'll continuously regenerate the Vitality Attribute, until it reaches the MaxVitality value.

Create a new Gameplay Effect.

![](new-ge.png)

With `Infinite` Duration, a period in seconds and an Attribute `Additive` modifier for `StatsAttributeSet.Vitality` and a scalable float.

![](regen-ge-details.png)

*Here, we add 5 Vitality every 1 seconds*

Add this Gameplay Effect to your `Startup Effects` array on your character.

![](startup-effects.png)

Now, launch the Game in PIE (Play in Editor) the `GSC_ShowDebugAbilitySystem` command (or `showdebug abilitysystem`). Type `Â²` within the game to open the command prompt.

![](vitality-attributes.png)

You should see the Vitality attribute going from 50 to 200 (the MaxVitality value) if we did everything correctly. If we didn't clamp, Vitality would increase forever.

### Test the Adjustment (in PreAttributeChange)

We'll now do a similar setup, but instead of creating a regenerate effect, we'll create a GameplayEffect that increase the MaxVitality attribute to apply when we hit a Keyboard input, to see if the related Vitality value is changed accordingly.

First, let's create the test GameplayEffect. This is going to be an `Instant` GameplayEffect with `StatsAttributeSet.MaxVitality` as an `Additive` modifier and a scalable float magnitude of `100`.

![](ge-test-addmax.png)

Now, open your character Blueprint and add a Keyboard input event of your choosing. From there, drag off the input event and implement the following: 

![](test-ge-input.png)

Make sure to configure your test GameplayEffect in the `Gameplay Effect Class` parameter.

We can now launch the game in PIE mode, open the gameplay debugger with `GSC_ShowDebugAbilitySystem` command (or `showdebug abilitysystem`) and hit the Keyboard input we added (maybe remove the Vitality regeneration effect from the character's Startup Effects so that it doesn't interfere with our testing).

![](ge-adjust-debug-test.png)

The Vitality attribute should change anytime we hit the keyboard input, keeping its relative ratio to MaxVitality.

This concludes the introduction of AttributeSetManager, and how you can do in Blueprints what you would previously be able to do only in C++ ;)
