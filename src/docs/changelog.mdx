[Full Changelog](https://github.com/GASCompanion/GASCompanion-Documentation/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## 3.3.0 (2022-02-07)

##### Bug Fixes

* **Attribute Set:**
  *  Simplify and fix formula used in AdjustAttributeForMaxChange (PreAttributeChange)
  *  Remove clamping in pre attribute change, should happen solely in PostGameplayEffectExecute
* **HUD:**
  *  Use final attribute value instead of base for bound widgets
  *  Fix `OnCooldownEnd` event not being triggered in HUD User Widget
* **MGCAbilitySystemComponent:**  Prevent granting of attributes twice for Player State ASC on remote clients
* **Game Features:**  Add Abilities action now properly supporting Player State as a target actor for the game feature action

##### Other Changes

* Change runtime modules loading phase from `Default` to `PreDefault` / Change `ModularGASCompanionEditor` loading phase from `Default` to `PostEngineInit`
* Move `InitGlobalData()` to PostEngineInit. This is a failsafe measure to ensure `InitGlobalData()` happens late enough even when not using an Asset Manager subclass to handle it.
* Add deprecated notice to all GSC prefixed actors from 2.0
* Store custom class layout class names so as to avoid issue in shutdown with -stompmalloc

##### Refactors

*  change default pawn class in both `AModularGameMode` and `AModularGameModeBase` to be `AModularPlayerStateCharacter`
* **Game Features:**  Split `AddActorAbilities()` into sub-methods

## 3.2.0 (2021-12-28)

##### New Features

* **AbilityInputBinding:**
  *  UMGCAbilityInputBindingComponent now provides a way to get back the InputAction that is bound to a given Gameplay Ability
      * Added `UMGCAbilityInputBindingComponent::GetBoundInputActionForAbility()` Blueprint exposed method
      * Designed to be called from within a Gameplay Ability event graph, passing self reference for the Gameplay Ability parameter.

</div>


* Add `GetAbilityInputBindingComponent` helper in Blueprint Function Library
* Added TriggerEvent param to Blueprint exposed `UMGCAbilityInputBindingComponent::SetInputBinding`

</div>



> The most common trigger types are likely to be Started for actions that happen once, immediately upon pressing a button, and Triggered for continuous actions that happen every frame while holding an input. <br /> <br />
> ***Warning***: *The Triggered value should only be used for Input Actions that you know only trigger once. If your action triggered event happens on every tick, this might lead to issues with ability activation (since you'll be trying to activate abilities every frame). When in doubt, use the default Started value.*

*  Add `UGSCAssetManager` to handle InitGlobalData and expose a setting to prevent GlobalData initialization from GAS Companion StartupModule
    *  New Plugin Setting: `Project Settings > Game > GAS Companion > Prevent Ability System Global Data Initialization in Startup Module`
    *  Turning on this option will disable the initialisation from happening in companion runtime module to let you handle it in either your AssetManager class or GameInstance. Also adding in UGSCAssetManager to handle that (the editor should prompt you if you'd like to use it when you turn on bPreventGlobalDataInitialization, notif should only appear if the Asset Manager Class Name is set to engine's default)

## 3.0.0 (2021-09-09)

A lot of the features and functionality added in this version related to Modular Gameplay comes from the Ancient Demo, with additions and fixes for multiplayer. 

Regarding support for 4.27 and Modular Game Features, a non trivial amount of work went into trying to backport as much and as close as possible developer experience from UE5 Early Access for Game Features. Includes the following (which are not available in 4.27 right now, or API not exposed to external code / modules)

- **Editor**
  - Game Feature Data Asset details customization (buttons within Data Asset to change Game Feature state, and ability to Edit plugin descriptor)
  - New data-only Game Feature plugin template
  - Prompt to add Asset Manager settings on first load
  - Custom Project policies to initliaze Game Features similar to ue5 (`BuiltInInitialFeatureState` in .uplugin)
- **Runtime**
  - Actor Extension Events system required for some Game Feature Actions (like `AddAbilities` or `AddInput`)

Other most significant changes, additions or new features compared to v2 includes:

- Enhanced Input integration with Ability System (either using MGCAbilitySystemComponent on new Modular Actors, or via Game Feature Action)
- Now able to grant AttributeSets **per** Actors (no need to configure them via Project's Settings anymore, can be done directly with Ability System Component in Blueprint)
- Possibility to initialize AttributeSets via Data Tables (no Instant Gameplay Effect required anymore, although you can still use one with `Granted Effects`)
- Support for "Passive" Abilities with `GSCGameplayAbility`
- Can tweak ASC ReplicationMode per actor (BP exposed property on Modular Actors, character / pawn or Player State)
- No major breaking changes, all the old `GSC` classes are still there. It's just that some of their API / Properties have been deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
- HUD UserWidget reworked to work with both v2 / v3 setup and doesn't rely on `GSCCoreComponent` anymore.
