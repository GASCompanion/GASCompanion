## 3.0.0 (2021-09-09)

A lot of the features and functionality added in this version related to Modular Gameplay comes from the Ancient Demo, with additions and fixes for multiplayer. 

Regarding support for 4.27 and Modular Game Features, a non trivial amount of work went into trying to backport as much and as close as possible developer experience from UE5 Early Access for Game Features. Includes the following (which are not available in 4.27 right now, or API not exposed to external code / modules)

- **Editor**
  - Game Feature Data Asset details customization (buttons within Data Asset to change Game Feature state, and ability to Edit plugin descriptor)
  - New data-only Game Feature plugin template
  - Prompt to add Asset Manager settings on first load
  - Custom Project policies to initliaze Game Features similar to ue5 (`BuiltInInitialFeatureState` in .uplugin)
- **Runtime**
  - Actor Extension Events system required for some Game Feature Actions (like `AddAbilities` or `AddInput`)

Other most significant changes, additions or new features compared to v2 includes:

- Enhanced Input integration with Ability System (either using MGCAbilitySystemComponent on new Modular Actors, or via Game Feature Action)
- Now able to grant AttributeSets **per** Actors (no need to configure them via Project's Settings anymore, can be done directly with Ability System Component in Blueprint)
- Possibility to initialize AttributeSets via Data Tables (no Instant Gameplay Effect required anymore, although you can still use one with `Granted Effects`)
- Support for "Passive" Abilities with `GSCGameplayAbility`
- Can tweak ASC ReplicationMode per actor (BP exposed property on Modular Actors, character / pawn or Player State)
- No major breaking changes, all the old `GSC` classes are still there. It's just that some of their API / Properties have been deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
- HUD UserWidget reworked to work with both v2 / v3 setup and doesn't rely on `GSCCoreComponent` anymore.
