GAS Companion provides a few Console Commands to help in debugging you can access via the built-in debug console. This is done via a [Cheat Manager](https://benui.ca/unreal/cheatmanager/) class.

The `GSCPlayerController` class is pre-configured with `GSCCheatManager` and provides the following commands.

### GSC_AbilityQueueDebug

This command shows / hides the [Ability Queue Debug Widget](/ability-queue-system#debug-widget)

![](ability-queue-debug-widget.png)

Here is a brief description of the debug widget:

- `Ability Queue Enabled` whether the ability queue is enabled for the player character
- `Ability Queue Opened` whether the ability queue is currently opened via the ability or anim montages. Abilities can be queued only within this window.
- `Allow All Abilities` the queue system requires a list of abilities to be allowed for activation. This boolean can be turned on in abilities or within anim montages (via notify state) state which will consider *all* abilities for activation.
- `Current Queued Ability` is updated when an ability attempts to activate within the ability queue opened window and fail to do so, setting it up for activation when the current ability ends.
- `Ability Queue Opened From Montages` at the bottom right displays a list of anim montages from which the ability queue was opened via notify state (`AbilityQueueWindow`)

### GSC_ShowDebugAbilitySystem

Shortcut command to `showdebug abilitysystem`.

### GSC_AbilitySystemNextCategory

Shortcut command to `AbilitySystem.Debug.NextCategory`.

See [GASDocumentation Debugging section](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation#debugging) for more information about the two above commands.
