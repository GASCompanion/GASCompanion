Once you have the plugin installed and enabled, you can start configuring it.

You can disable / enable the plugin in `Edit > Plugins > Gameplay > GASCompanion`.

## Configuring HUD Widget (optional)

You can change the default HUD User Widget used by the Player Controller.

GAS Companion provides three basic HUD Widget Blueprint for demonstration purpose:

- `WB_HUD` Default Widget as seen in the above picture
- `WH_HUD_TopLeft` Same Widget but with a slight variation in the positioning of the attributes progress bar
- `WB_HUD_Minimalist` Another HUD variation, this time with a minimalist feel

If you want to create a custom Widget for your HUD, you can refer to the [UI Documentation page](/working-with-ui).

## Configuring Attributes Minimum Values (optional)

You can configure configure the minimum values of attributes when clamping is done by the provided AttributeSet's [PostGameplayEffectExecute](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation#concepts-as-postgameplayeffectexecute).

This is an optional step, as the default value for minimum values are `0`, which is the common expected behavior.

This is however useful to specify when using abilities with `bIgnoreAbilityCost` set to true, which allow activation of abilities even if the applied cost would go into negative values, and only prevented if the attribute is 0 or below.

**Example:** *If you have a regeneration effect on an attribute, it would then take longer for the attribute to go positive again.*

More information about [Ignore Ability Cost for Abilities](/ignore-ability-cost) in the corresponding page.

To configure in Unreal Editor, go to `Edit > Project Settings > Game > GASCompanion`.

The above configuration would result in the following **DefaultGame.ini** file

```ini
[/Script/GASCompanion.GSCDeveloperSettings]
+MinimumValues=(Attribute=(AttributeName="Stamina",Attribute=/Script/GASCompanion.GSCAttributeSet:Stamina,AttributeOwner=None),MinimumValue=-60.000000)
+MinimumValues=(Attribute=(AttributeName="Mana",Attribute=/Script/GASCompanion.GSCAttributeSet:Mana,AttributeOwner=None),MinimumValue=-20.000000)
```
