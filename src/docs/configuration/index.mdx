Plugin configuration described in this page is saved and loaded from your **Config/DefaultGame.ini** file.

**Note** Documentation update for 3.0.0 is in progress. If you're looking for the previous Quick Start documentation for 4.26, you can find it [here](/v2/quick-start)

Attribute Sets configuration via Project's Settings to define which Attribute Sets to grant for Actors has been deprecated, since it's now possible to grant Attributes **per** actor directly using the new Ability System Component (MGCAbilitySystemComponent).

### Attributes Minimum Values

You can configure the minimum values of attributes when clamping is done by the provided AttributeSet's [PostGameplayEffectExecute](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation#concepts-as-postgameplayeffectexecute).

This is an optional step, as the default value for minimum values are `0`, which is the common expected behavior.

This is however useful to specify when using abilities with `bLooselyCheckAbilityCost` set to true, which allow activation of abilities even if the applied cost would go into negative values, and only prevented if the attribute is 0 or below.

**Example:** *If you have a regeneration effect on an attribute, it would then take longer for the attribute to go positive again.*

More information about [Ignore Ability Cost for Abilities](/ignore-ability-cost) in the corresponding page.

To configure in Unreal Editor, go to `Edit > Project Settings > Game > GASCompanion - Attribute Sets`.
