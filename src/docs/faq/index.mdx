## The question about character class

### v2

In v2, there is two main Character class you can use: `GSCPlayerCharacter` and `GSCAICharacter`

You are free to use whatever class for your base blueprint, however you have to understand why those 2 classes exists. The main difference between them: 

- `GSCPlayerCharacter`: uses PlayerState to hold the Ability System Component (ASC) and attributes. Also ASC replication mode is set to Mixed.
- `GSCAICharacter`: Does not use PlayerState and have ASC living on Pawn. Replication mode is set to Minimal.

With that being said, if you look at the actual implementation, those are really thin classes. You don't really have to merge them and feel like you should use a single base class at all cost, if you design your implementation with actor components. Most of the commonly shared functionality and API in Companion is done via `GSCCoreComponent`which is present in both character classes. You can opt to do the same.

The naming of those classes is a bit off and doesn't really reflect why they're separated.

## v3

In v3, it has been reworked to be `ModularCharacter` (equivalent of `GSCAICharacter`, ASC on pawn) and `ModularPlayerStateCharacter` (equivalent of `GSCPlayerCharacter`, ASC on PlayerState). Also v3 allows you to change ASC replication mode on child blueprints.
