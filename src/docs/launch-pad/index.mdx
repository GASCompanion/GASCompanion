Introduced in 2.0.x version of the plugin, the Launch Pad Window can be used to browse and explore examples maps that demonstrates some features of GAS Companion.

**Credits** The Launch Pad Window is heavily inspired by [Dungeon Architect](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/dungeon-architect) Launch Pad. Huge thanks to its author for creating such a high-quality and inspiring plugin.

## Access Launch Pad

You can open the Launch Pad Window using GAS Companion dropdown menu in the Level Editor toolbar:

### Open Map

Open the map and freely explore the example scene. Some examples may have dependencies on other marketplace assets, in which case the Launch Pad will warn you and prevent the opening.

### Install Dependencies

Some examples rely on external assets from the marketplace (usually those made available for free by Epic Games like Paragon assets, or from other creators kind enough to provide free assets / plugins like AGR Pro). When the LaunchPad is opened, it will check if dependencies are installed and available in your project.

You can click the dependency link to open the asset URL on the marketplace from where you can download and install or import it in your project. In the case of Code Plugins (like AGR Pro), you'll need to first install the plugin in Engine, and then enable it in your Project's Plugin window (and restart the editor).

### Open Documentation
