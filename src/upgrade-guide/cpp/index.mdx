**Summary**

- All deprecated classes and API have been removed
- Runtime modules have been consolidated into a single one. `ModularGASCompanion` module has been removed and all classes from that module moved to `GASCompanion` module.
- All MGC prefixed classes have been renamed and now prefixed with GSC.
- `ModularGASCompanionEditor` module removed. Only existed to backport ue5 functionality related to Game Features (now handled in engine directly)

> WIP

## Gameplay Actors

- All Modular Gameplay Actors have been moved from `ModularGASCompanion` to `GASCompanion` module.
- Renamed with GSC prefix (so for instance: `AModularCharacter` became `AGSCModularCharacter`)
- Relative path remains the same (eg. `ModularGameplayActors/...`)

if you were using those classes, and subclassing them. You need to adjust the include and class name.
